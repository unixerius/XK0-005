# Assignment 1

Use "vi" or "nano" to create ~/at-test.sh.

Contents:

	#!/bin/bash
	echo "Hello!" >> /tmp/at-test.txt
	date >> /tmp/at-test.txt

Make the script executable:

	chmod +x ~/at-test.sh

You may need to install at:

	sudo yum install -y at
	
or
	
	sudo apt install -y at

Then schedule it to run in one minute. According to the man-page for at, you can read how to specify times in /usr/share/doc/at/timespec.

	sudo at now + 1 minute -f /home/tess/at-test.txt

Verify that the file was changed.

	ls -lrt /tmp
	cat /tmp/at-test.txt

Then schedule it to run every minute.

	crontab -e

This opens your editor (might ask you to choose an editor). Add:

	* * * * * /home/tess/at-test.txt

You can check whether the file is changed every minute:

	tail -f /home/tess/at-test.txt



# Assignment 2

Use an editor (like vi or nano) to create /opt/mysvc.sh. Because this is in /opt, you will need to use sudo.

	sudo vi /opt/mysvc.sh

Contents:

	#!/bin/bash
	echo "This was logged at: $(date)." >> /var/log/mysvc.log

Make it executable:

	sudo chmod +x /opt/mysvc.sh

Run the script, to verify that it works and that the log file is made.

	sudo /opt/mysvc.sh
	ls -lrt /var/log
	sudo cat /var/log/mysvc.log

Let's make a systemd service unit, using the instructions from https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019672

	sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/mysvc.service

Contents:

	[Unit]
	Description=An example service from Tess.

	[Service]
	ExecStart=/bin/bash /opt/mysvc.sh

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

Let systemd find the new service:

	systemctl daemon-reload

Test that the service works

	sudo systemctl start mysvc
	ls -lrt /var/log
	cat /var/log/mysvc.log

Enable the service at boot time.

	sudo systemctl enable mysvc

Testing!

	sudo reboot

After the boot, let's check!

	ls -lrt /var/log
	sudo cat /var/log/mysvc.log

I hope it worked! It should have added a new message (with the right time stamp) after the boot.
